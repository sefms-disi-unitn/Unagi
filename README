This is a RCP application I'm slowly developing in the context of my PhD/Post-doctoral research (see publications here: http://disi.unitn.it/~vitorsouza/academia/).

The purpose of the tool is to guide a developer through our proposed approach for the design and development of adaptive systems. We have developed a monitoring framework using Eclipse-based technology, so I decided to create a RCP application that provides a better UI for this.

This is an Eclipse project. If you want to contribute or just run it, I suggest you install Eclipse Juno for RCP developers and use its Git support to clone the repository.

Moreover, this is an Eclipse E4 RCP Application, therefore I also suggest you follow the instructions in Lars Vogel's tutorial and install the necessary plug-ins for E4 development: http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipseRCP/article.html

Finally, you will also need the following plug-ins:
- EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK

By the way, if you use Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity, set environment variable UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 before running Eclipse, otherwise the application menu will now show (might also happen with other distros that use Unity. If you changed to gnome-shell/Gnome 3 or classic/Gnome 2, you're probably safe).

Questions, comments, contributions, please contact me.
