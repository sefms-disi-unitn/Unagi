This is a RCP application I'm slowly developing in the context of my PhD research (see publications here: http://disi.unitn.it/~vitorsouza/academia/).

The purpose of the tool is to guide a developer through our proposed approach for the design and development of adaptive systems. We have developed a monitoring framework using Eclipse-based technology, so I decided to create a RCP application that provides a better UI for this.

This is an Eclipse project. If you want to contribute or just run it, I suggest you install Eclipse Indigo for RCP developers and use its Git support to clone the repository.

By the way, if you use Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity, set environment variable UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 before running Eclipse, otherwise the application menu will now show (might also happen with other distros that use Unity. If you changed to gnome-shell/Gnome 3 or classic/Gnome 2, you're probably safe).

Questions, comments, contributions, please contact me.
